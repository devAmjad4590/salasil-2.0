# Project TODO List

This file tracks the major issues and tasks for the Salasel 2.0 project.

## High Priority

- **[FEATURE]** Implement the tab-switching logic and placeholder UI for the `VideoDetailsTabs` component (Search, Summary, Transcription).
- **[FEATURE]** Ensure basic video player functionalities (play, pause, seek, volume) are working correctly with the chosen library.

## Medium Priority
- **[BUG]** Debug image loading indicator (spinner/shimmer) not appearing on `SelectedPlaylistCard`. The `onLoad` event or a styling/stacking issue might be preventing the loading state from being visible.

- make the continue watching button take you to the latest watch video (right now its set to the first video, later remove that logic once you implement the localstorage progress)
